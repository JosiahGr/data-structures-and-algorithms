A gapful number is a number of at least 3 digits that is divisible by the number formed by the first and last digit of the original number. 

Write a program to check if the user input is a gapful number or not.

#### Ex: 
input: 192
output: true(192 is gapful because it is divisible by 12)

input: 210
out: flase(210 is not divisible by 20)
